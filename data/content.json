      "content": "<p>As the seasons change, so do our moods and the scents that resonate with us. Understanding how different fragrances align with seasonal shifts can help create a harmonious living space year-round.</p><h2>Spring: Fresh and Floral</h2><p>Spring calls for light, refreshing scents that mirror the blooming world outside. Citrus notes like lemon and bergamot bring energy, while floral scents such as jasmine and lavender create a sense of renewal.</p><h2>Summer: Bright and Energizing</h2><p>Summer fragrances should be vibrant and uplifting. Ocean-inspired scents, tropical fruits, and light florals help maintain a cool, refreshing atmosphere during warm months.</p><h2>Autumn: Warm and Cozy</h2><p>As temperatures drop, turn to warm, spicy scents. Cinnamon, vanilla, and amber create that perfect cozy feeling. Wood-based fragrances like sandalwood add depth and comfort.</p><h2>Winter: Rich and Comforting</h2><p>Winter is the time for deep, luxurious scents. Pine and fir bring the outdoors in, while spices like clove and nutmeg create a festive atmosphere. Don't forget the classics: vanilla and cocoa for ultimate comfort.</p>"

      "content": "<p>Proper candle care not only extends the life of your candles but also ensures they burn safely and beautifully. Follow these expert tips to get the most out of your AURA candles.</p><h2>The First Burn Matters</h2><p>The first time you light your candle is crucial. Allow the wax to melt completely across the entire surface before extinguishing. This prevents tunneling and ensures even burning throughout the candle's life.</p><h2>Trim the Wick</h2><p>Before each use, trim the wick to 1/4 inch. This prevents excessive smoke, uneven burning, and maintains a steady flame. Use proper wick trimmers for best results.</p><h2>Burn Time Guidelines</h2><p>Never burn a candle for more than 4 hours at a time. This prevents the vessel from overheating and maintains the fragrance quality. Allow the candle to cool for at least 2 hours before relighting.</p><h2>Keep It Clean</h2><p>Remove any debris or wick trimmings from the wax pool. Keep the wax pool clear and clean for optimal burning and scent throw.</p><h2>Safe Placement</h2><p>Always place candles on a heat-resistant surface away from drafts, children, and pets. Never leave a burning candle unattended.</p>"
